## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**lasalbinuwara/lasalbinuwara** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m an **undergraduate student at SLIIT**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and exploring **water quality monitoring systems**, IoT, and network design.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects involving **Arduino, ESP32**, water sensors, and AI concepts. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:  
  - Enhancing my **IoT and sensor-based projects**.  
  - Learning **best practices in network design** using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer.  
  - Getting feedback and ideas for my **water quality monitoring systems**.  
  - Collaborating on **open-source design and technology projects**.  
  - Improving my **Adobe Stock and design portfolio** with fresh perspectives.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
  - IoT systems and sensor integration (e.g., **pH and turbidity sensors**).  
  - Designing **water quality monitoring solutions**.  
  - Network design and Cisco Packet Tracer projects.  
  - Creating **AI-generated art concepts** and stock photography.  
  - Tools like **Arduino, ESP32, Octave**.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love combining **art and technology**â€”whether it's designing IoT systems for water quality or creating **AI-generated art**. I believe every project is a chance to innovate and express creativity in new ways!
